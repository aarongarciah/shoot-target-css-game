This game is made entirely with HTML and CSS. Shoot as many targets as you can!

- [Custom cursor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Basic_User_Interface/Using_URL_values_for_the_cursor_property) using an [SVG data url](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46017733/2767771)
- [Animations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations) and the ability to pause them with [`animation-play-state`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-play-state)
